# Jupyter Notebooks for AVIRIS-NG

*Check out **link:this-repo** at ORNL DAAC's GitHub page for more AVIRIS-NG examples using data from ABoVE.*

A number of generic functions are defined in the notebooks to simplify steps previously covered. All functions take exactly one argument, an gdal.Dataset from an ENVI format binary image file.
